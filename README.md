## Skills measured and links

- Deploy and Configure Infrastructure (25-30%)
  - Analyze resource utilization and consumption
    - Configure diagnostic settings on resources
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-overview#diagnostic-settings>
      - Resource logs - these logs come from Azure services that deploy resources within an Azure subscription, such as Network Security Groups or Storage Accounts.
      - Resource diagnostic logs are configured using resource diagnostic settings. Tenant diagnostic logs are configured using a tenant diagnostic setting.
      - Where diagnostic logs and metrics are sent (Storage Account, Event Hubs, and/or Log Analytics).
      - Which log categories are sent and whether metric data is also sent.
      - How long each log category should be retained in a storage account. A retention of zero days means logs are kept forever. Otherwise, the value can be any number of days.
      - Collection of diagnostic logs can be enabled as part of creating a resource in a Resource Manager template or after a resource is created from that resource's page in the portal. You can also enable collection at any point using Azure PowerShell or CLI commands, or using the Azure Monitor REST API.
    - Create baseline for resources
      - **TODO**
    - Create and raise alerts
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric>
      - Metric alerts in Azure Monitor provide a way to get notified when one of your metrics cross a threshold. Metric alerts work on a range of multi-dimensional platform metrics, custom metrics, Application Insights standard and custom metrics.
      - ```az monitor metrics alert create -n {nameofthealert} -g {ResourceGroup} --scopes {VirtualMachineResourceID} --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 90" --description {descriptionofthealert}```
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-classic-portal>
      - Classic metric alerts in Azure Monitor provide a way to get notified when one of your metrics cross a threshold. Classic metric alerts is an older functionality that allows for alerting only on non-dimensional metrics. There is an existing newer functionality called Metric alerts which has improved functionality over classic metric alerts.
      - In the portal, locate the resource that you want to monitor, and then select it. In the MONITORING section, select Alerts (Classic).
      - ```az monitor alert create --name <alert name> --resource-group <group name> --action email <email1 email2 ...> --action webhook <URI> --target <target object ID> --condition "<METRIC> {>,>=,<,<=} <THRESHOLD> {avg,min,max,total,last} ##h##m##s"```
      - After you create an alert, you can select it and do one of the following tasks:
        - View a graph that shows the metric threshold and the actual values from the previous day.
        - Edit or delete it.
        - Disable or Enable it if you want to temporarily stop or resume receiving notifications for that alert.
    - Analyze alerts across subscription
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric>
      - In the Manage rules blade, you can view all your alert rules across subscriptions. You can further filter the rules using Resource group, Resource type and Resource. If you want to see only metric alerts, select Signal type as Metrics.
    - Analyze metrics across subscription
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-charts>
      - If you have more than one Azure subscription, Metrics Explorer pulls out the resources across all subscriptions that are selected in the Portal Settings -> Filter by subscriptions list.
    - Create action groups
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/action-groups>
      - An action group is a collection of notification preferences defined by the owner of an Azure subscription. Azure Monitor and Service Health alerts use action groups to notify users that an alert has been triggered. Various alerts may use the same action group or different action groups depending on the user's requirements.
      - Email / SMS / Push / Voice / Function / LogicApp / Webhook / ITSM / Runbook
    - Monitor for unused resources
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview>
      - Azure Advisor is a service that, among other things, identifies virtual machines with low utilization from a CPU or network usage standpoint. From there, you can decide to either shut down or resize the machine based on the estimated cost to continue running the machines. Advisor also provides recommendations for reserved instance purchases. The recommendations are based on your last 30 days of virtual machine usage. When acted on, the recommendations can help you reduce your spending.
    - Monitor spend
      - **TODO**
    - Report on spend
      - **TODO**
    - Utilize Log Search query functions
      - **TODO**
    - View alerts in Log Analytics
      - **TODO**
  - Create and configure storage accounts
    - Configure network access to the storage account
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security>
      - Configure storage accounts to deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic) by default. Then grant access to traffic from specific VNets. This configuration enables you to build a secure network boundary for your applications. You can also grant access to public internet IP address ranges, enabling connections from specific internet or on-premises clients.
      - When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data from over the specified set of networks can access a storage account.
      - Network rules are enforced on all network protocols to Azure storage, including REST and SMB. To access the data with tools like Azure portal, Storage Explorer, and AZCopy, explicit network rules are required.
      - Virtual machine disk traffic (including mount and unmount operations, and disk IO) is not affected by network rules.
      - There are some cases where exceptions must be granted to enable full functionality. You can configure storage accounts with exceptions for trusted Microsoft services, and for access to storage analytics data.
      - ```az storage account update --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --name "mystorageaccount" --bypass Logging Metrics AzureServices```
      - <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/virtual-network-service-endpoints-and-firewalls-for-azure-storage-now-generally-available/>
      - To enable VNet protection, first enable service endpoints for storage in the VNet. Virtual Network Service Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resource to only your virtual network. Service endpoints also provide optimal routing for Azure traffic over the Azure backbone in scenarios where Internet traffic is routed through virtual appliances or on-premises.
      - On the storage account you can select to allow access to one or more VNets. You may also configure to allow access to one or more public IP ranges.
    - Create and configure storage account
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal>
      - ```az storage account create --name storagequickstart --resource-group storage-quickstart-resource-group --location westus --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2```
      - ```New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name "storagequickstart" -Location $location -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2```
    - Generate shared access signature
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs>
      - Right-click the desired blob container, and - from the context menu - select Get Shared Access Signature.
    - Install and use Azure Storage Explorer
      - <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/>
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows>
      - Easily manage Storage anywhere from Windows, macOS, and Linux
      - Access multiple accounts and subscriptions across Azure, Azure Stack, and the sovereign Cloud
      - Create, delete, view, and edit storage resources
      - View and edit Blob, Queue, Table, File, Cosmos DB storage and Data Lake Storage

      - Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
      - Gain easy access to manage your virtual machine disks
      - Work with either Azure Resource Manager or classic storage accounts, plus manage and configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) rules.
    - Manage access keys
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1>
      - Account key and Shared access signatures (SAS). Your storage account includes both a primary and secondary access key, both of which grant administrative access to your account, and all resources within it. Exposing either of these keys opens your account to the possibility of malicious or negligent use. Shared access signatures provide a safe alternative that allows clients to read, write, and delete data in your storage account according to the permissions you've explicitly granted, and without need for an account key.
      - A shared access signature provides delegated access to resources in your storage account. With a SAS, you can grant clients access to resources in your storage account, without sharing your account keys. This is the key point of using shared access signatures in your applications--a SAS is a secure way to share your storage resources without compromising your account keys.
      - Your storage account key is similar to the root password for your storage account. Always be careful to protect your account key. Avoid distributing it to other users, hard-coding it, or saving it anywhere in plaintext that is accessible to others. Regenerate your account key using the Azure portal if you believe it may have been compromised.
      - A SAS gives you granular control over the type of access you grant to clients who have the SAS, including:
        - The interval over which the SAS is valid, including the start time and the expiry time.
        - The permissions granted by the SAS. For example, a SAS for a blob might grant read and write permissions to that blob, but not delete permissions.
        - An optional IP address or range of IP addresses from which Azure Storage will accept the SAS. For example, you might specify a range of IP addresses belonging to your organization.
        - The protocol over which Azure Storage will accept the SAS. You can use this optional parameter to restrict access to clients using HTTPS.
      - You can create two types of shared access signatures:
        - Service SAS. The service SAS delegates access to a resource in just one of the storage services: the Blob, Queue, Table, or File service.
        - Account SAS. The account SAS delegates access to resources in one or more of the storage services. All of the operations available via a service SAS are also available via an account SAS. Additionally, with the account SAS, you can delegate access to operations that apply to a given service, such as Get/Set Service Properties and Get Service Stats. You can also delegate access to read, write, and delete operations on blob containers, tables, queues, and file shares that are not permitted with a service SAS.
